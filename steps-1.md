### Creating a Github hosted hugo site

```jshelllanguage
  $ hugo new site .
  Error: D:\PROJECTS\ashutosh049.github.io already exists and is not empty. See --force.
```

```jshelllanguage
   Admin@DESKTOP-6G798VA MINGW64 /d/PROJECTS/ashutosh049.github.io (main)
   $ hugo new site . --force

   Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in D:\PROJECTS\ashutosh049.github.io.

   Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

   1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
   2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>\<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
   3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

   Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
