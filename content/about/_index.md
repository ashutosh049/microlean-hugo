## **Overview**

I’ve been architecting, designing and implementing desktop, web and distributed applications since
2015, initially a desktop application written in Java deployed to standalone platforms. Beginning in
2017 I began working with highly-scaleable/highly-available microservice applications using Java,
Spring, and since 2019 I'm into cloud native app development.

My current interests are in the areas of highly scalable/highly available distributed applications,
Docker, Kubernetes, cloud architectures, and critical thinking and problem solving. My blog reflects
these interests.

## **My Skills**

I firmly believe in the notion of T-Shaped Skills. My speciality is the Java ecosystem of tools,
libraries, frameworks and languages. While most of my career I have worked in Java, I'm trying my
hands in javascript and node. While I’m not married to the Spring framework (I don’t have very
strong personal preferences), it is where I have most of my experience, which also reflects itself in
that it’s a common subject in my blog.

I have good social skills and can relate to 'the business' just as well as I can relate to other
developers. I like acting in a role where I can act as a bridgehead between these different
specialities. I like working in multidisciplinary / feature teams that solve 'real' problems. I am
good at striking a balance between software quality and value add both in the short term and over
longer maintenance periods.

As my blogs and articles: I like teaching almost as much as I like learning. My goal as
a lead developer is to also help others to learn and improve, while at the same time learning from
them.
